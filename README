Xtreme3D v2 for C. Fork of Xtreme3D v2 for C++ by Timur Gafarov.
About Xtreme3D library/engine you can read here: http://xtreme3d.narod.ru

How to build it:
1. Download it and extract somewhere to.
2. Download and install MinGW32 (if you have not it) and add path to its "bin/" folder in PATH variable of OS.
3. Open MSYS and jump to directory where you extract Xtreme3D v2 for C.
4. Commands:
	For delete object files and config.h:
		make clean
	For build C-language binding of Xtreme3D.dll only:
		make
	For build C-language binding of Xtreme3D.dll and some addidional functions
		make INC_WINDOW=yes
	Or
		make INC_TIMER=yes
	Or
		make INC_WINDOW=yes INC_TIMER=yes
	For rebuild enter "make clean" and then one of build commands above
There is 2 build options: INC_WINDOW=yes and INC_TIMER=yes. First adds window creation functions to C-language binding library. Second adds timer functions. Originally Xtreme3D.dll does not contain this functions and if you wish, you can use external libraries of window creation and timer functions. 

How to use it:
1. Build it.
2. Copy folders "include" and "lib" to your project.
3. Use "xtreme3d.h" only for including all library functions. Use "libxtreme3d_2c.a" for link to your program
4. Copy "Xtreme3D.dll" and "ode.dll" to folder where are executable file of your game.
Enjoy.

Source codes released to public domain (read UNLICENSE). Some parts of code copypasted from Xtreme3D v2 for C++ and samples for it (I cheked it in source texts).
License for Open Dynamics Engine ("ode.dll") you can read here: http://www.ode.org/ode-license.html
I do not know under what license are "Xtreme3D.dll". I think it is abandonware.

Work in progress. Docs and samples will be soon... May be.
I am sorry for my bad English.
